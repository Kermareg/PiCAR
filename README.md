# PiCAR-GC
Project using a Rpi with touchscreen that will be fitted in a car. A GPS sensor will be inserted to allow a openstreetmap view.

This software is intended to create a small device fitted in a 3D printed enclosure placed on the dashboard of a car. 
The device will include a software part and a hardware part. It'll run on a Raspbery Pi with a touchscreen.

The main functionality is to display an openstreetmap view and some GPS informations. On the map view, geocaches (www.geocaching.com) will be drawn and a simple navigation process will me developped.
